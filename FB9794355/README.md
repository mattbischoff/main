iCloud Tabs that are no longer open on my iPhone continually show up on my Mac. Attempting to close the tabs via Right Click → Close Tab works for a few minutes, but then after opening Safari again a while later they reappear.

Turning Safari’s iCloud syncing off and on again does not solve the issue. 

This is not an isolated issue:

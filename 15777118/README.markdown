## Summary:

In iOS 7.1 the keyboard shift button appearance changed and is causing a lot of confusion. It's very difficult to tell whether the button is active or in Caps Lock mode. This is especially problematic when a field autocapitalizes and a user mistakenly believes they must tap the button as it looks disabled.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Type using the iOS 7.1 keyboard
2. Try to make words and letters capital

## Expected Results:

A easy to use keyboard shift button

## Actual Results:

A confusing keyboard shift button

## Version:

iOS 7.1 beta 3

## Notes: 

## Configuration:

iPhone 5s and iOS Simulator
